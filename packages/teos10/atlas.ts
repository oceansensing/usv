/**
 * TEOS-10: the Absolute Salinity Anomaly atlas.
 *
 * The one part of this package that needs the network, and the one part that
 * is not computable: the anomaly was *measured* across the world ocean and
 * published as a lookup table. Everything else here is a standard you can
 * evaluate from first principles; this is a map of what the salt is actually
 * made of, which varies because rivers, biology and the deep circulation put
 * different things in different oceans.
 *
 * It reaches 0.03 g/kg in the North Pacific, where silicate and alkalinity
 * accumulate along the deep flow path. That is about 0.024 kg/m^3 of density
 * — thirty times the precision anyone quotes it to, and invisible unless you
 * apply it.
 *
 * **Fetched, not bundled, and only when a position is given.** 188 KB
 * gzipped, so a reader who never enters a latitude never pays for it. That is
 * the same bargain the map strikes with its coastline and its isobaths.
 *
 * The file is built by `scripts/make-saar-atlas.py`, which verifies its own
 * extraction against the GSW reference implementation before writing.
