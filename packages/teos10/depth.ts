/**
 * TEOS-10: height against pressure, and gravity.
 *
 * Not a thermodynamic conversion but a geometric one, and it is the place a
 * calculator most easily goes subtly wrong. Sea pressure and depth are not
 * proportional: gravity varies with latitude by about half a percent between
 * the equator and the pole, and the water column's own weight per meter
 * depends on how dense it is. TEOS-10 resolves this by defining `z` through
 * the geopotential of Standard Seawater at 0 degC, which is what
 * `enthalpySSO0` below is.
 *
 * So depth *needs a latitude*, and the calculator asks for one. Ignoring it
 * costs about 5 m at 5000 dbar between 0 and 60 degrees -- small, and larger
 * than any other error on this page.
 *
 * `z` is negative in the ocean, as TEOS-10 defines it. The calculator shows a
 * positive depth alongside, because that is what people say.
 *
 * Coefficients transcribed from GSW-C; see `gibbs.ts` on why by machine.
