/**
 * A small scatter/line plot with a color axis.
 *
 * Extracted from `SlocumDecoder.astro` in the oceansensing.github.io
 * repository, where it was 250 lines inside a 3,700-line component and could
 * not be used by anything else. The drawing is that engine's, comments and
 * hard-won details included; three things are new, and each is here because
 * this site asks something of it that the decoder did not.
 *
 * **1. Columns, not rows.** The decoder built a `number[][]` — one small
 * array per point. This site's data arrives as `Float64Array` columns
 * straight out of the ERDDAP parser and the TEOS-10 worker, and a
 * 700,000-row deployment would mean 700,000 array allocations to hand it
 * over in the old shape. `Series` is three typed arrays and a length, which
 * is what both producers already have.
 *
 * **2. An `underlay` hook.** A T–S diagram is unreadable without density
 * contours behind the points, and those contours are traced by TEOS-10 in
 * data coordinates. The hook is handed the projection and draws before the
 * points, so the engine never learns what density is.
 *
 * **3. Honest decimation.** The decoder drew at most 4,000 points, silently.
 * At that limit a glider section loses its structure — 18,000 binned samples
 * is a normal overview here — so the cap is a parameter, higher by default,
 * and the number actually drawn comes back in the result for the caption to
 * report. A picture that has quietly dropped nine tenths of its data and
 * says nothing is the failure this whole file is otherwise careful about.
 *
 * Structural color — the axes, the ticks, the uncolored trace — is a class,
 * so a theme switch restyles the plot with no redraw. The color axis is the
 * one exception and has to be: it encodes a value rather than a role, and a
 * value cannot be named in a stylesheet.
