/**
 * The deployment track, on a map.
 *
 * A glider's path is the one figure that is not a plot: where it went is a
 * question about the ocean, not about the water it measured. Drawn as a
 * polyline coloured by time, so a reader can see the order the mission
 * happened in rather than only its shape.
 *
 * Coloured in segments rather than as one line, because SVG and Leaflet both
 * stroke a path in a single colour. The segment count is capped — a thousand
 * polylines is a thousand DOM nodes and the map stops panning smoothly —
 * which is a resolution decision about the *drawing*, not about the data.
